<div id="bio">
	<p> I was born in Harare, Zimbabwe into a family which was heavily engulfed in art. With my father being one of the largest African Sculpture curators and my mother being a musician, the creative fields were never something distant. At a young age, I began mimicking the artists around me, making tiny tone sculptures. This was the birth of my creative drive and It couldnâ€™t have happened in more of a welcoming environment. <br> <br>

From Zimbabwe, at age 7, I began touring the world with my parents, accompanying them to each exhibition. This was another impactful period as it allowed me to gain perspective from the constant immersion into foreign cultures. In addition, due to their occupation, we would frequent many museums ,gardens and various collections which furthered that perspective with an emphasis on art. <br> <br>

At age 14, my father had suffered heath complications so we decided to move back to Zimbabwe where things were slower paced. At this point, I attended the Harare International School and decided to take an IB course in Art. This was the solidification of my interests in arts and the creative fields. From there, I started experimenting with all forms of arts and design. I drew heavily from artists such as Misha Hollenbach, Basquiat and a plethora of others.  </p>
