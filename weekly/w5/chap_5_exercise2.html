<h2><b>Low and Slow</b></h2>
	<p>This week I am <em>extremely excited</em> about a new cooking technique called <i><dfn>sous vide</dfn></i>. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>
<p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>
